## Styleguide

- Hooks that are tightly coupled to a tool should be prefixed with the name (e.g., `webpackRules`, `jestConfig`). Hooks that are for a more general concept can omit the prefix, which makes it easier to be consistent across different tasks (e.g., `extensions`).
- Dash case for CLI flags
